    "Many people has confusions in this topic as they think; GET is using for getting the data and POST is for sending the data.But in the real scenario, the situation is different. GET and POST both are basically using for sending the data to the server. While the main defference between them is that; GET is sending the data to url also, so it is visible in url.While POST method always save the data in the format of body so it is not visible in the url. That why, Post is considered as more secure method also,"
